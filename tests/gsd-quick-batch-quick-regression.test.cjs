/**
 * gsd-quick-batch-quick-regression.test.cjs — row 48 of the #3676 test
 * matrix: ordinary `/gsd:quick` (non-batch) stays byte-identical after
 * Phase 4 lands.
 *
 * Named `gsd-quick-batch-*` (not `quick-batch-*`) so `scripts/
 * lint-test-file-count.cjs`'s longest-prefix bucketing does not fold this
 * markdown-only test into the already-capped `quick-batch` production-module
 * bucket (2/2 test files from the CORE-layer pass).
 *
 * `commands/gsd/quick.md` / `gsd-core/workflows/quick.md` are never touched
 * by this phase (design doc row 38/48) — quick-batch adds new call sites
 * onto shared primitives, never edits the ordinary quick command/workflow.
 * Asserted via the same base-ref resolution helper `tests/
 * emitted-attribution.test.cjs` already uses (`resolveBase`/`resolveChangedPaths`,
 * `tests/helpers/emitted-runtime.cjs`) — a three-dot diff against the merge
 * base, never a hand-rolled git call.
