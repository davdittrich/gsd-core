# Revision Loop Pattern

Standard pattern for iterative agent revision with feedback. Used when a checker/validator finds issues and the producing agent needs to revise its output.

---

## Pattern: Check-Revise-Escalate (max 3 iterations)

This pattern applies whenever:
1. An agent produces output (plans, imports, gap-closure plans)
2. A checker/validator evaluates that output
3. Issues are found that need revision

### Flow

```
prev_issue_count = Infinity
iteration = 0
previous_conflict_keys = []
conflict_return_count = 0

LOOP:
  1. Run checker/validator on current output
  2. Read checker results
  3. If PASSED or only INFO-level issues:
     -> Accept output, exit loop
  4. If BLOCKER or WARNING issues found:
     a. If iteration + 1 > 3:
        -> Escalate to user (see "After 3 Iterations" below)
     b. Parse issue count from checker output
     c. If issue_count >= prev_issue_count:
        -> Escalate to user: "Revision loop stalled (issue count not decreasing)"
     d. Re-spawn the producing agent with checker feedback appended
     e. If the agent returns REVISION_CONFLICT:
        -> conflict_return_count += 1
        -> If conflict_return_count >= 3:
             escalate through the iteration-cap gate
        -> current_conflict_keys = sorted unique (issue_identity, required_property) pairs
        -> If current_conflict_keys intersects previous_conflict_keys:
             escalate as a stall (a chosen resolution did not take)
           Else: previous_conflict_keys = current_conflict_keys
             resolve it (see "Conflict Return" below) and go to step d.
             Do NOT update prev_issue_count or increment iteration -- the conflict was not a failed attempt.
     f. If the agent returns its explicit completion marker:
        -> previous_conflict_keys = []
        -> prev_issue_count = issue_count; iteration += 1; go to LOOP
     g. Otherwise (unknown, empty, or both markers): offer Retry or Stop.

The baseline update and increment are step f, only after explicit producer completion.
```

### Issue Count Tracking

Track the number of BLOCKER + WARNING issues returned by the checker on each iteration. If the count does not decrease between consecutive iterations, the producing agent is stuck and further iterations will not help. Break early and escalate to the user.

Display iteration progress before each revision spawn:
`Revision iteration {N}/3 -- {blocker_count} blockers, {warning_count} warnings`

### Re-spawn Prompt Structure

When re-spawning the producing agent for revision, pass the checker's YAML-formatted issues. The checker's output contains a `## Issues` heading followed by a YAML block. Parse this block and pass it verbatim to the revision agent.

The field names are the plan-checker's schema (`agents/gsd-plan-checker.md` → `<issue_structure>`):
`plan` or `plans`, `dimension`, `severity`, `required_property`, `description`, `task`, `fix_hint`.
`plan` and `plans` are mutually exclusive; omit both for phase-level issues. There is no
`suggested_fix`, `finding`, or `affected_field` field — those names were drift.

```
<checker_issues>
The issues below are in YAML format. Each has: dimension, severity,
required_property, description, fix_hint.

BINDING: required_property (the invariant that must hold), description (the
evidence it does not), severity. NON-BINDING: fix_hint -- ONE example route to
the property, never an instruction.

Satisfy the required_property of ALL BLOCKER issues. Satisfy WARNING issues
where feasible.

{YAML issues block from checker output -- passed verbatim}
</checker_issues>

<revision_instructions>
Address ALL BLOCKER and WARNING issues identified above.
- For each BLOCKER: make required_property true. Its fix_hint is one example
  route; a smaller or different mechanism that makes the same property true
  addresses the issue in full -- report which mechanism you used.
- For each WARNING: address or explain why it's acceptable
- Before editing, re-check locked decisions, active capability guidance, and
  constraints the existing output already encodes. If a fix_hint would
  contradict one of those, or the property is unreachable without breaking one,
  do NOT apply it and do NOT work around it: return REVISION_CONFLICT naming
  the conflict and the alternatives considered, having addressed every
  non-conflicting issue.
- Do NOT introduce new issues while fixing existing ones
- Preserve all content not flagged by the checker
This is revision iteration {N} of max 3. Previous iteration had {prev_count}
issues. You must reduce the count or the loop will terminate.
</revision_instructions>
```

### Conflict Return (REVISION_CONFLICT)

A revision agent that returns `REVISION_CONFLICT` has not failed and has not stalled. Handle it
BEFORE the iteration counter and the stall check — a conflict is not resolvable by re-running the
same loop, so spending retry budget on it only exhausts the cap:

**This protocol is shared.** Every revision-bearing workflow follows it — `plan-phase`, `quick`,
`ui-phase`, and `verify-work`'s gap-plan loop. `plan-phase` @-imports this reference and states
only its own bindings (counter name, artifact path, next step). The other three do not import it,
so they restate the operative rules inline; this section is the authority they must agree with.

1. **Do not spend budget.** Do NOT increment the iteration counter and do NOT update
   `prev_issue_count`. Do NOT re-spawn the checker yet — the conflict is not a revised output.
2. **Record**, where the host has a channel an arbitration loop reads. `review.md` emits one
   fixed writer-owned slot at the first nonblank line after the artifact title, between
   `<!-- gsd:plan-revision-conflicts:begin -->` and
   `<!-- gsd:plan-revision-conflicts:end -->`. When `workflow.plan_review_convergence` is enabled
   and the phase `*-REVIEWS.md` already exists, `plan-phase` appends one line per conflict under
   `## Plan-Revision Conflicts` inside that slot:

```markdown
- [ ] REVISION_CONFLICT {issue_identity} — required_property: {property} | conflicts with: {locked decision D-nn / CLAUDE.md rule / plan constraint} | alternatives: {the agent's alternatives}
```

   A checkbox, not a table row: `- [ ] REVISION_CONFLICT` is open and `- [x] REVISION_CONFLICT`
   is resolved. The reader counts matching open lines only inside the first nonblank slot after the artifact title; an identical marker in reviewer output is not state. An open line in the owned
   slot blocks convergence even if this run is abandoned.
   A workflow with no such channel (`quick` has no phase and no REVIEWS.md) skips this step.

   Before appending, reuse the existing open line instead of appending a duplicate when its
   sanitized fields identify the same conflict. This makes persisted conflict state idempotent.

   **Sanitize before writing — the conflict text is agent-authored.** Validate every returned
   conflict field, including `issue_identity` and `required_property`, as an already encoded
   nonempty canonical value of valid UTF-8: only RFC 3986 unreserved bytes or uppercase `%HH`;
   strictly decode and re-encode to prove equality. Empty or invalid input: do not write; report
   `BLOCKED`. Decode a validated copy only for user display; keep the encoded originals for keys,
   persistence, and transport, and never encode them again. percent-encode the raw
   chosen_resolution's UTF-8 bytes exactly once with the same codec, leaving only RFC 3986
   unreserved bytes. One conflict is exactly one line beginning `- [ ]`; never append raw agent
   text or a fenced block.
3. **Resolve** — present the conflict and its alternatives to the user and ask which to take
   (pattern: `gsd-core/references/gate-prompts.md`): adopt a named alternative / override the
   named constraint and apply the hint / amend the constraint itself. Each option resolves the
   conflict. Accepting the output with the blocker still open is NOT offered here — the blocking
   `required_property` still fails, and that choice belongs to the cap escalation.
4. **Re-spawn** with every sanitized
   `{issue_identity} | required_property: {property} | chosen_resolution: {chosen_resolution}`
   triple in the revision prompt, keeping recorded lines open; re-evaluate its return from the top of this handler.
5. **Close after application** — `## REVISION COMPLETE` must echo each applied triple under
   `### Applied Conflict Resolutions`. Only an exact identity/property/choice match lets the writer
   flip that line to `- [x]` and append ` | resolved: {chosen resolution}`. Unknown, empty,
   ambiguous, failed,
   or abandoned returns leave it open.

**Bounded — two ways, because one is evadable.** Not incrementing must not make this path
unbounded:

- **Repeat.** Derive the sorted unique `(issue_identity, required_property)` keys for every return.
  Any canonical conflict key repeated in consecutive returns means its resolution did not take;
  stop and escalate as a stall.
- **Total.** Count every conflict return in this revision loop, whatever property each names. On
  the THIRD, stop and escalate — an agent that alternates property names never trips the repeat
  rule, so the repeat rule alone leaves the loop unbounded. This total is what actually bounds the
  path; the repeat rule just catches the common case sooner.

Both escalate through the same gate the iteration cap uses. A conflict still never consumes a
revision iteration — the cap on conflicts is separate from, and additional to, the cap on
revisions.

**No workflow hands a conflict to a loop and returns.** Asking the user is the route everywhere;
recording is in addition to asking, never instead of it. `plan-phase` in particular never invokes
`/gsd:plan-review-convergence` — it runs *inside* that loop, so invoking it would be a cycle, and
"was I invoked by convergence?" is not a question the orchestrator can answer at runtime.

### After 3 Iterations

If issues persist after 3 revision cycles:

1. Present remaining issues to the user
2. Use gate prompt (pattern: yes-no from `gsd-core/references/gate-prompts.md`):
   question: "Issues remain after 3 revision attempts. Proceed with current output?"
   header: "Proceed?"
   options:
     - label: "Proceed anyway"   description: "Accept output with remaining issues"
     - label: "Adjust approach"  description: "Discuss a different approach"
3. If "Proceed anyway": accept current output and continue
4. If "Adjust approach" or "Other": discuss with user, then re-enter the producing step with updated context

### Workflow-Specific Variations

| Workflow | Producer Agent | Checker Agent | Notes |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| plan-phase | gsd-planner | gsd-plan-checker | Revision prompt via planner-revision.md |
| execute-phase | gsd-executor | gsd-verifier | Post-execution verification |
| discuss-phase | orchestrator | gsd-plan-checker | Inline revision by orchestrator |

## Important Notes

- **INFO-level issues are always acceptable** -- they don't trigger revision
- **Each iteration gets a fresh agent spawn** -- don't try to continue in the same context
- **Checker feedback must be inlined** -- the revision agent needs to see exactly what failed
- **Don't silently swallow issues** -- always present the final state to the user after exiting the loop
- **A remediation hint is an example, not an order** -- an issue satisfied through a smaller valid
  mechanism is addressed, and counts as resolved for the issue-count and stall checks
